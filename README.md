## No Warranty

Run it at your own responsibility. You should read and understand the code, it's really not that big. You should assure yourself yourself that it is not serving your /etc/password to every nearby StarBucks customer when you run this app with Pow on your Macbook; you hipster you. If it is, please tell me about it or better, send a pull request.
